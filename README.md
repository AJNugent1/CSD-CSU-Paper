To compare EWS calculated from time-varying parameter simulations against analytic expressions run SimulatingEWS_AdaptedSISModel.m 
This requires GillespieSIS_TimeVaryingParameters.m only.

To run the EFM for the adapted SIS model run RunningEFM_AdaptedSISModel.m 
This requires GillespieSIS_FixedParameters.m , EquationFreeMethod.m , EFM_PolynomialFitting.m and RunningEFM_AdaptedSISModel_3Dplot.m

To apply the EFM to a different simulation model requires only EquationFreeMethod.m , the Matlab code begins with a description of requirements on the model simulation function.
